I have a home alarm system that currently lacks API integration capabilities. However, it does offer a web console that allows me to interact with it. This console serves as a bridge between my network and the alarm central, enabling communication between the two.

Although the device is currently simple in nature, it holds the potential for future enhancements and expanded functionality.
